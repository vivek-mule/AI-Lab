Established in 2015, we are a fully licensed transport and logistics provider offering door-to-door freight, parcel, and specialized transport solutions across Greenfield, Riverbend, and Northport with partner coverage for nationwide and international shipments. Our registered office is at 12 Harbor Road, Riverbend, State of Aurora, 560102. Registration number REG-2015-7843 and GSTIN GSTIN-AUR-0001234 are used for administrative purposes. Our mission is safe, on-time delivery with transparent pricing, real-time visibility, and reliable customer service available Monday–Saturday, 09:00–18:00 IST, with enterprise 24×7 options under contract. We operate an owned-and-partner-managed network to ensure flexible capacity and coverage.

Our service portfolio includes same-city couriers, intercity and long-haul transport, express parcel delivery, full-truckload (FTL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) services, fragile and cold-chain handling, vehicle transport, warehousing and fulfillment, reverse logistics for returns, and tailored project cargo solutions. International shipments are coordinated through vetted freight forwarders and customs brokers; customers are expected to provide required export/import documentation and to be responsible for duties and taxes unless otherwise agreed. For specialty moves such as household shifting or white-glove deliveries we conduct on-site surveys and provide project quotes that account for packing, handling, and any required permits.

Our fleet comprises 120 GPS-enabled vehicles including motorcycles for documents and fast parcels, small vans (<1.5T), medium trucks (3–7.5T), rigid trucks (10–18T), container trailers, and refrigerated trucks for cold-chain requirements; every vehicle follows a fixed maintenance schedule and carries mandatory insurance. Bookings can be made via website, mobile app, phone, or API: customers request a quote with pickup/delivery addresses, weight and dimensions, declared value and any special instructions, confirm the booking, and choose payment (prepaid or COD where applicable). Pickup windows are scheduled at booking with same-day pickups available in select zones; transit times vary by route and service level and an estimated ETA is supplied on the quote.

Pricing is calculated from distance, actual or volumetric weight (whichever is greater), dimensions, service type (express versus standard), any required special handling, fuel surcharges, COD fees, and insurance. Volumetric weight is computed using the industry-standard formula Length (cm) × Width (cm) × Height (cm) ÷ 5000 unless a different divisor is specified on a quote. All invoices are GST-compliant and itemized, showing taxes and any applicable surcharges; enterprise customers can opt for consolidated monthly billing. Discounts and volume pricing are available for high-volume or long-term contracts and seasonal promotional codes may apply.

Real-time tracking is provided through live GPS on the website and app with automatic SMS and email milestone updates at pickup, in-transit events, and delivery. Business customers receive API access and webhooks for automated integration; sample endpoints include [https://api.logistics.example/quote](https://api.logistics.example/quote), [https://api.logistics.example/book](https://api.logistics.example/book), [https://api.logistics.example/track/{id}](https://api.logistics.example/track/{id}), and [https://api.logistics.example/cancel/{id}](https://api.logistics.example/cancel/{id}), with sandbox access and API keys provided during onboarding. Proof of Delivery is digital, containing the receiver’s electronic signature, name, timestamp, GPS-tagged photo when applicable, and driver notes — PODs are accessible through the portal and emailed after delivery.

Documentation requirements depend on the shipment type: standard domestic parcels require sender and receiver name, phone, address, and invoice/packing list for commercial shipments; high-value or commercial consignments require GST/commercial invoices and value declarations. International consignments require a commercial invoice, packing list, and any export/import licences. Hazardous, explosive, flammable, or illegal items are not accepted except by explicit pre-approval with required permits and compliant packaging; perishables and fragile goods must be packed to specified guidelines and cold-chain services booked when required.

Declared value insurance is available at booking and is recommended for high-value items; standard liability limits apply by default and are disclosed on the booking confirmation and in the Terms & Conditions. In the event of loss or damage, customers must file claims within seven days of delivery or the expected delivery date and supply booking reference, POD, photos of damage, invoice/packing list, and the completed claim form. Claims are acknowledged within two business days and typically investigated and resolved within 7–21 business days depending on complexity; exact SLAs are detailed in the claims policy and contract.

Cancellation and rescheduling are allowed prior to pickup subject to tariffs and availability, with partial refunds where applicable; repeated changes may incur fees. COD is supported in eligible areas with specified COD fees and weekly settlement cycles for merchants. Accepted payment methods include online card/UPI/netbanking, NEFT/RTGS, popular wallets, and corporate monthly invoicing for approved accounts. Return logistics are supported via reverse-pickup scheduling on the portal or through customer support, with return charges depending on pickup location, weight, and dimensions.

Customer support triage is immediate during support hours via phone and chat, with email tickets acknowledged within 12 business hours for standard customers and accelerated SLAs for enterprise accounts. For unresolved issues customers are routed from support to the account manager or the grievance/legal contact at [legal@logistics.co](mailto:legal@logistics.co) or +91-98765-43210; escalation procedures are provided in onboarding materials. Privacy and data security are enforced through role-based access controls and encrypted storage where appropriate; sender, recipient, transaction, and tracking data are retained to provide services and are processed in accordance with applicable privacy laws. API keys and credentials must be kept secure by customers.
